# ReduxSimpleStarter

Personal Project following Stephen Grider's React/Redux course with slight changes.

The branches other than master indicate the modules I've finished so far.

### Getting Started

Branch:
* master: current progress
* 01: React codebits
* 02: React codebits
* 03: React + redux codebits
* 04: React + redux codebits
* 05: Weather App with react + redux

#### Familiar with Git?
Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```

> cd react-codebits
> npm install
> npm start
```
